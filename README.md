# Stock Market API with Auth0 Integration

This repository provides an API for retrieving stock market data using Node.js and integrating with Auth0 for secure authentication and authorization. The API leverages JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) to ensure secure communication between parties.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Overview

JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are a secure and efficient method for exchanging information between parties. A JWT consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature.

- The header contains information about the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm used for security.
- The payload carries user information and additional data. It includes reserved claims for standard information and custom claims for application-specific data.
- The signature ensures the integrity of the token and prevents tampering. It is generated by combining the encoded header, payload, and a secret key using the chosen algorithm.

JWTs are widely used in various systems and frameworks to facilitate secure communication while maintaining data integrity and authenticity.

## Stock Market API Endpoints

This API provides the following endpoints for retrieving stock market data:

### Symbol Search

- `GET /public/symbol-search`: Search for a stock ticker or symbol based on a keyword.

### Company Profile

Endpoints for retrieving company profile information.

- `GET /private/company-profile/{symbol}`: Get the company profile for a specific symbol.
- `GET /private/company-profile/{symbol}/metrics`: Get the company profile metrics for a specific symbol.
- `GET /private/company-profile/{symbol}/dividends`: Get the dividends for a specific symbol.

### Company Overview

Endpoints for retrieving general company information.

- `GET /private/company-overview/{symbol}`: Get the overview of a company for a specific symbol.

## Implementation Details

The API utilizes the Auth0 platform for secure authentication and authorization. It has been integrated with an Express.js application using the `express-oauth2-jwt-bearer` package.

To set up the API, make sure you have created an API in your Auth0 dashboard and obtained the API Identifier. The API Identifier is used to validate access tokens.

This repository serves as a guide for setting up your own API with Node.js, Auth0 integration, JWT usage, and Swagger documentation. It includes a disclaimer that the stock market data is obtained from the [Alpha Vantage API](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

Please refer to the documentation and code in this repository to understand the implementation details and effectively use the API.
