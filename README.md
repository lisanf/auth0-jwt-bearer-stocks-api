# Auth0 JSON Web Token (JWT)

Auth0 JSON Web Token (JWT) is a secure and efficient way to exchange information between parties for authentication and authorization. It consists of three parts: the header, the payload, and the signature.

* The header contains the token type (JWT) and the signing algorithm used for security.
* The payload carries the user information and additional data. It includes reserved claims (standard information) and custom claims (specific to your application).
* The signature ensures the token's integrity and prevents tampering. It's generated by combining the encoded header, payload, and a secret key using the chosen algorithm.

JSON Web Tokens are widely used in various systems and frameworks for secure communication. They provide a compact and reliable method for transmitting information while maintaining data integrity and authenticity.
